	<h2>Why can't my app connect to my server?</h2>
	<p>Evothings applications running in the viewer are served over HTTPS from our proxy servers in the cloud. This means any connections made from the application <strong>must</strong> be secure. Your application <strong>must</strong> use HTTPS or WSS (Secure Web Sockets) with the server presenting <strong>proper</strong> (not self signed) certificates.</p>
