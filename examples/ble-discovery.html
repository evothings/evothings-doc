	<h1>BLE Discovery</h1>

	<p><b>Find Information About BLE Devices.</b> This app demonstrates how to discover Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices within communication range of the app, and how to connect to and display data for a device.<p>

	</p>You must run this app in Evothings Viewer, or build a Cordova app with the plugin com.evothings.ble. Device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3 or higher required.</p>

	<h2>Source code</h2>

	<p>You can browse the source code for this example at the
	<a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/tree/master/examples/ble-discovery">Evothings GitHub repository</a></p>

	<p>The file <a href="https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/blob/master/examples/ble-discovery/index.html">index.html</a> is the main file of the app.

	<h2>What you need</h2>

	<img style="width:100px;height:auto;float:left;" src="images/ti-sensortag-cc2650.png"/>

	<p>This example runs in Evothings Viewer on Android or iOS.</p>

	<p>You need to run the example in Evothings Viewer. Alternatively, you can make a Cordova application if you wish to distribute the app. You then need to include the Cordova plugin com.evothings.ble. Read more in the documentation of the <a href="../studio/evothings-viewer.html">Evothings Viewer</a>.</p>

	<p>An iOS device or an Android device with support for Bluetooth 4.0 (which includes BLE) is required. For Android version 4.3 or later is needed. Please note that BLE support on Android is still not fully mature. As a result, you may experience difficulties running this example. If the app stops working, restart Evothings Viewer and/or reset Bluetooth on the device.</p>

	<p>You also need at least one BLE device you can work with, for example the <a href="http://ti.com/sensortag">TI Bluetooth Smart SensorTag</a>.</p>

	<h2>How to get up and running</h2>

	<p>Follow these steps to get started with this example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Run Evothings Workbench on your desktop/laptop computer.</li>
		<li>Run Evothings Viewer on an Android mobile device and connect to the Workbench.</li>
		<li>Launch the example "BLE Discovery" from the Workbench window.</li>
		<li>If you use the TI SensorTag, press the "activate" button on the tag.</li>
		<li>If everything works, the app should automatically detect BLE devices within range and display device and sensor information.</li>
	</ul>
