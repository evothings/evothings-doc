	<h2>Two Ways to Share Apps</h2>
	<p>It is fun to share apps you create with others. To make your work available to others, you have the following options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Put your HTML and JavaScript files on a web server and run the app
from the Evothings Client app (estimated time 15 minutes).</li>
		<li>Build a native app with Apache Cordova (estimated time 2 - 8 hours), and publish on the app stores (estimated time 4 - 16 hours depending on which app stores you target).</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="RunYourAppFromEvothingsClient" class="box">
	<h2>Run Your App From Evothings Client</h2>
	<p>To run your app from Evothings Client, do as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Upload your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and media files (images) to a web server. Note that you don't need to include any Cordova JavaScript files. The file cordova.js and Cordova plugin files are bundled with the Evothings Client app.</li>
		<li>Install and run the Evothings Client app on your mobile device.</li>
		<li>Enter the url to the main HTML file on the web server in the address
field, and press the Connect button. For example if you have
index.html in the folder "demo", you can enter a url like this (just as with a web page!): http://evothings.com/demo</li>
		<li>You can also make a menu page with links to all of your apps, and
open that page in Evothings client.</li>
		<li>The drawback is you must be online to run your apps.</li>
		<li>The positive thing is that it is very quick and easy to share apps with others. Just ask them to install the Evothings Client app and supply a url to your app or start page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To make sharing of apps even easier, you can create links using the evothings: URL scheme. Evothings links can be shared by email or on any website, e.g. on Twitter, on a blog or on an intranet page. The user just selects the link, and the Evothings Client app launches with the app pointed to by the link. <p>
	<p>Here is an example:</p>
	<pre>evothings://mysite.com/demo/myapp.html</pre>
	<p>That URL will launch the Evothings Client app and open:</p>
	<pre>http://mysite.com/demo/myapp.html</pre>

<div id="BuildNativeAppWithCordova" class="box">
	<h2>Build a Native App With Cordova</h2>
	<p>Apache Cordova is a build system for creating native apps with bundled HTML and JavaScript content. Apps built with Cordova are native apps that can be published on the app stores.</p>
	<p>The <a href="apps-build-overview.html">Native App Build Overview</a> shows how to build apps with Cordova.</p>
</div>

<div id="SummaryAndAdvice" class="box">
	<h2>Summary and Advice</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Start out easy and deploy your app on a web server, then run it
from the Evothings Client app.</li>
		<li>If you have several apps you wish to share, make an index page that acts like a menu or gallery you can use as a launchpad (just put links to your apps
on the menu page, as you would for any web page).</li>
		<li>When you are ready for app store publication, learn how to build native apps with Cordova.</li>
	</ul>

<!--
Building a native app with Apache Cordova:

* Install the mobile development kit(s) you want to build for (e.g.
Android, iOS, Windows Phone)
* For iOS you need a Mac with Xcode and an Apple developer
 membership to install apps on devices.
* For Android you need the Android SDK.
* Install Apache Cordova and create a template app by following the
instructions in this tutorial:
http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface
* The above step can take some time and effort to complete!
* Copy your HTML, CSS, JavaScript and media files to the www folder in
the Cordova project.
* Now build and test your app. The output depends on the platform. For
iOS you get an Xcode project you can open and run, for Android you get
and apk-file you can install on your device.
* Note that it works perfectly fine to develop the Cordova app in
Evothings Studio. Just drag and drop index.html in project list in the
Workbench window. Then run the app using Evothings client, or ...
* Enter the connect url in place of index.html in config.xml. When you
start the app it will connect to the Workbench, just click run to
launch your app.
* You can now build your app and deploy it to the app stores.
* Drawback: The build process can be complex and you must have the
SDKs installed and the right app store memberships. But this is on the
other hand true of any app you wish to publish.
