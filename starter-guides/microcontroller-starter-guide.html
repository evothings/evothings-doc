	<h1>Getting Started With Mobile Apps for Microcontrollers</h1>

	<p>In this Starter Guide we look at how to make mobile apps that communicate with microcontrollers like Arduino, RedBearLab, Nordic ARM mbed boards, LinkIt One, ESP8266, and many more.</p>

	<h2>Example Apps</h2>

	<img class="evo-content-side-image-large" src="images/arduino-led-tcp-board-photo.jpg" />
	<p>Among the <a href="../examples/examples.html">Evothings example apps</a> you will find many apps that communicate with microcontrollers. The documentation pages for the examples have instructions for how to configure hardware and software.</p>
	<p>Each example is included with Evothings Studio. Click the COPY button in Evothings Workbench to make a copy of the example app(s) you wish to run.</p>
	<p>Note that several of the example apps need modification to run, like entering configuration information for BLE. You will find instructions in the documentation.</p>

	<h2>Tutorials</h2>

	<p>There is a section on the <a href="../tutorials/tutorials.html">tutorials page</a> that lists articles and blog posts related to making apps for microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>

	<h2>Things</h2>

	<p>On the <a href="https://evothings.com/things/" target="_blank">Things page</a> you will find a collection of resources for different hardware. For each hardware category, there are blog posts, tutorials, and example apps.</p>

	<h2>Get Started With Evothings Studio</h2>

	<p>It is easy to get up and running with Evothings Studio. Visit the <a href="https://evothings.com/download/" target="_blank">download page</a> and be up and running in just 5 minutes!</p>
